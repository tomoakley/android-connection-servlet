# PlaqueIt server connection

This is for my Computer Science course at Brunel University, module CS2001. This code sits on the server and connects to the database. It uses a Servlet because that's what our module leader requires us to use. I would use a more Restful approach but it's unfortunatley not possible.

Built so far: Basic login (without password right now)

Coming soon: Register, favouriting plaques

Usage: http://SERVERURL:GROUPPORT/tom/Login?email=hello@domain.com (this will return false because hello@domain.com doesn't exist in the database)
